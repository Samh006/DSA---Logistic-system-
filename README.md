# DSA---Logistic-system-
I've created a simple logistic system using graphs to map out a city, hash table for customer insertion, max heap for customer priority extraction and a simple merge sort to sort deliveries based on travel time at the end of the day (lowest to highest). Refer to the README files in each module for more information.
